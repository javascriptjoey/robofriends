## Robofriends React App
This project was programmed with React.js

## :mortar_board: The Goal of this application was to build a react application and utilize all the core features of react.
To learn how to build things into components and into containers and finally into a page in order to combine things and have an application.

1. Creating Components
2. Creating Containers
3. State
4. Props
5. Children
6. Fetching data from API 
7. Life Cycle Methods 
8. Filtering Data 
9. Working with text inputs 
10. Working with event listeners and handling changes in response to state updates
11. Creating a Scroll to wrap components 
12. Error handling thinking ahead and outside the box

## :octocat: One Way data flow
I learned everything travels from state to props and I can have multiple children but the only thing that can change state is a container component.
Data flows one way and any time anything changes on a child component that just triggers an event on the parent.
