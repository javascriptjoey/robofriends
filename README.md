## Rockin Robots React App :iphone:
This project was programmed with React.js
and I used a really cool CSS framework called tachyons.io to add a touch of magic :sparkles: to the styling

## The Goal of this application was to build a react application and utilize all the core features of react :mortar_board:
To learn how to build things into components and into containers and finally into a page in order to combine things and have an application 

- Creating Components
- Creating Containers
- State
- Props
- Children
- Fetching data from API 
- Life Cycle Methods 
- Filtering Data 
- Working with text inputs 
- Working with event listeners and handling changes in response to state updates
- Creating a Scroll to wrap components 
- Error handling thinking ahead and outside the box

## One Way data flow :octocat:
I learned everything travels from state to props and I can have multiple children but the only thing that can change state is a container component
Data flows one way and any time anything changes on a child component that just triggers an event on the parent
