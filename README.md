# Robofriends React App

This project was programmed with React.js

The Goal of this application was to build a react application and utilize all the core features of react. 

To learn how to build things into components and into containers and finally into a page in order to combine things and have an application.

# One Way data flow
I learned everything travels from state to props and I can have multiple children but the only thing that can change state is a container component.

Data flows one way and any time anything changes on a child component that just triggers an event on the parent.
