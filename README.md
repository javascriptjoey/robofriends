## Robofriends React App
This project was programmed with React.js

## :mortar_board: The Goal of this application was to build a react application and utilize all the core features of react.
                  To learn how to build things into components and into containers and finally into a page in order to combine things and have an application.

*Creating Components
*Creating Containers
*State
*Props
*Children
*Fetching data from API 
*Life Cycle Methods 
*Filtering Data 
*Working with text inputs 
*Working with event listeners and handling changes in response to state updates
*Creating a Scroll to wrap components 
*Error handling thinking ahead and outside the box

## :octocat: One Way data flow
I learned everything travels from state to props and I can have multiple children but the only thing that can change state is a container component.
Data flows one way and any time anything changes on a child component that just triggers an event on the parent.
